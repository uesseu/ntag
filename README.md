# ntags
A python package to enable tag style command line file management.
Written for my daily life.

# Why?
Because I wanted such CLI tools Like "FenrirFS".
But I could not find such tools. That is all.

# Feature
- Made by python and sqlite3.
- Tag does not removed even if file is moved.
- Not so light weighted, because of python.
  + But has enough speed for daily life.
- Written for "me".
- Only for unix like system.
  + Because it follows inode now.
  + If I or you want windows version, it may be developped.
